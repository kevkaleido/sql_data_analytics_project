# Exploratory Analysis in SQL

This project makes use of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. The scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more.

**Note:** It represents the next step from the Data Warehouse Project I completed previously. You can explore the Data Warehouse Project here   [here](https://github.com/kevkaleido/sql-data-warehouse-project).

## Project Structure

The analysis is structured in two progressive phases:

1. **Basic Data Exploration** - Foundational queries to understand data structure and core business metrics
2. **Advanced Analytics** -  Time-series analysis, performance comparisons, and customer segmentation

## Key Analytical Areas Covered

- Core business metrics and KPI calculations
- Customer demographics and geographic distribution
- Product performance analysis and rankings
- Time-series analysis and trend identification
- Running totals and cumulative metrics
